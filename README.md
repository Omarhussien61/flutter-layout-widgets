# Contacts App demo
This is a simple contact screen to demo the usage of Flutter layout widgets. It's a re-implementation of the [Flutter Galary](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/tree/master/examples/flutter_gallery) contacts app.

The app demos the usage of Flutter layout widgets, including

- Row / Column (and the alignment properties)
- Stack
- Expanded (with the usage of `flex` property)
- SizedBox

Note: For demo purposes, the app doesn't implement the [sliver app bar](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/SliverAppBar-class.html).
